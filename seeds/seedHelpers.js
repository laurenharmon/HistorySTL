       name: "Old Courthouse",
       yearDeveloped: 1816,
       latitude: 38.625674,
       longitude: -90.189274,
       history: "The Old Courthouse in Downtown St. Louis, part of Gateway Arch National Park, was built between 1839 and 1862. Some of the most pivotal court cases in American history were heard inside its courtrooms. It is where Dred and Harriet Scott sued for freedom, Virginia Minor fought for her right as a woman to vote, and more than 300 enslaved African-Americans filed suit for their freedom. On Wednesday, February 3, 2021, The National Park Service and Gateway Arch Park Foundation announced that the Old Courthouse at Gateway Arch National Park will undergo renovations beginning in late 2021. The renovations are part of the final component of the $380-million CityArchRiver project, which has resulted in the revitalization of the Gateway Arch park grounds, Arch Visitor Center, Museum at the Gateway Arch, St. Louis Riverfront, Luther Ely Smith Square, and Kiener Plaza. The CityArchRiver project is the largest public-private partnership in the history of the National Park Service."

    name: "Basilica of Saint Louis, King of France",
    yearDeveloped: 1834,
    latitude: 38.641884,
    longitude: -90.254845,
    history: "The history of the Parish of Saint Louis – known fondly as the “Old” Cathedral – and the early history of the City of St. Louis are inextricably bound. Over the course of the last 180 years, they have borne witness to many important events and forever galvanize the Old Cathedral’s place among the most historically significant in our community. The Old Cathedral is unique, both in St. Louis and across America. It couples a museum that contains many artifacts from the early days of the Catholic Church in St. Louis and local historical information of an active parish community. The parish has survived waves of cholera, fire, arson attempts, urban development that began with the westward migration of thousands of Americans, the Civil War and World War I and II."

    name: "The Gateway Arch",
    yearDeveloped: 1963,
    latitude: 38.624691,
    longitude: -90.184776,
    history: "The monument we know today began in 1935, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt designated property along the St. Louis riverfront to be developed as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial (now known as Gateway Arch National Park). While the land was cleared for construction, the City of St. Louis deeded the Old Courthouse to the National Park Service to be incorporated into the Memorial. In 1948, a nationwide design competition determined what shape the Memorial would take, and in 1963, construction began on architect Eero Saarinen’s design for a stainless steel arch. Completed in 1965, the Gateway Arch stands as a symbol of national identity and an iconic example of mid-century modern design. Anchoring the west end of the Park, the Old Courthouse is a prime example of mid-19th century federal architecture. Built in 1839, the Courthouse served as the site of a number of landmark civil rights cases, including the Dred Scott decision. In the 1830s, the enslaved Scott was taken to free territory in Illinois and Wisconsin before being brought back to Missouri. In 1847 and 1850, under Missouri’s “once free, always free” doctrine, Scott sued for his freedom at the St. Louis Courthouse. In 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court decided against Scott and his wife Harriet, ruling that African-Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in court. Dissent over the decision helped to speed the start of the U.S. Civil War four years later."

    yearDeveloped: 1874,
    latitude: 38.6289399,
    longitude: -90.1789994,
    history: "Eads Bridge is the world's first steel-truss bridge, and an engineering marvel. After the Civil War and the expansion of the nation's railroad system, it became apparent that for St. Louis to survive, a bridge across the Mississippi River was essential.  In 1867, the St. Louis Bridge and Iron Company, made up of a group of City bankers and businessmen, hired James Buchanan Eads (1820-1887) to build one.  Eads was a self-educated engineer and had never built a bridge before.  But during the Civil war, he had been called on by Washington to construct several Ironclad gun ships and completed his contract in an incredible 65 days. The construction of the bridge began in 1867.  Giant granite-faced piers support three graceful arches and two decks.  Eads Bridge was the first bridge to carry railroad tracks, the first to use tubular cord members and the first to depend entirely on cantilever construction for its superstructure. Pneumatic caissons were used for the first time in the U.S. in the construction of its piers, which were sunk to the unprecedented depth of 123 feet. The bridge was completed for a cost of nearly $10 million, and dedicated on July 4, 1874.  In recognition of this unparalleled engineering achievement, Eads Bridge was named a National Historic Landmark, the highest designation given by the National Park Service, in 1964.  It was made a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1971 and designated a City Landmark the same year."

    longitude: -90.1927162157736,
    history: "The Old Post Office is located at 815 Olive.  Designed by architect Alfred Mullett in the French Second Empire style, the Old Post Office was completed in 1884.  Constructed of Red Missouri granite and gray Maine granite, the fortress-like design reflects the uneasiness that permeated the nation following the Civil War.  The Old Post Office is a National Historic Landmark and was listed as a City Landmark in 1971."

    longitude: -90.19202955968156,
    history: "Located at 701 Chestnut St. the Wainwright Building was designed by the famed architects Adler and Sullivan in 1891.  The Wainwright building is credited for being the first successful utilization of steel frame construction.  The first two floors are faced in brown sandstone, the next seven stories rise in continuous brick piers.  Terra cotta panels of ornate foliage relief's decorate the each floor.  The tenth story is a frieze of intertwined leaf scrolls framing circular windows, and is capped with Sullivan's characteristic overhanging roof slab.  The building became a City Landmark in 1972.  The Wainwright building is also a National Historic Landmark."
